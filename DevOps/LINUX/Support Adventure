Think of a DHCP server like a librarian handing out books. Each book is like an IP address, a unique identifier for devices on a network.

New Device Needs a Book: When a device (like your computer or phone) connects to the network, it needs an IP address to talk to other devices.
Librarian Gives Out a Book: The DHCP server automatically picks a free IP address ("book") and gives it to the device. It also tells the device how long it can "borrow" the address.
Devices Can Now Talk: With its unique IP address, the device can now send messages and find other devices on the network.
